# Architecture

How the app is put together. For what it does, see [features.md](features.md); for where files
live, see [file-structure.md](file-structure.md).

## Big picture

```
                         ┌──────────────────────── MacpardyApp (App) ────────────────────────┐
                         │  owns:  GameState   BuzzerState   BoardEditorSession.shared       │
                         │  keeps BuzzerState in sync with GameState via .onChange(…)        │
                         └──────┬───────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬─────────────┘
                                │                       │                      │
                    Window "control"         Window "display"      Window "create-macpardy"
              LaunchScreenView → ControlView   PresentationView     CreateMacpardyGameView
                   (host)                       (TV / projector)        (board editor)
                                │
          ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┐
          ▼                     ▼                             ▼
   Board files            GameSaveStore (actor)          BuzzerServer (actor)
   BoardPackage           Application Support/           Network.framework, port 8472
   BoardLoader            saved_game.json                HTTP GET / → buzzer.html
   CSVBoardImporter                                      WebSocket /ws ⇄ phones
   ImageImporter
```

Everything runs in one process on the host's Mac. There is no backend, and the app never
opens outgoing connections.

## Windows (scenes)

Defined in `App/MacopardyApp.swift`:

| Window id | Default | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `control` | Opens at launch | `LaunchScreenView` until a game is chosen (`hasSelectedGame`), then `ControlView` |
| `display` | Suppressed; opened from the board screen | `PresentationView`, only when a game is loaded |
| `create-macpardy` | Suppressed; opened from New Game / Edit | `CreateMacpardyGameView` |

`MacopardyAppDelegate` intercepts quit (`applicationShouldTerminate`) so the editor can ask
to save unsaved edits. `Views/Shared/WindowCloseGuard` does the same for closing the editor
window, since SwiftUI has no close hook outside document apps.

## Menu commands

Keyboard shortcuts are defined once, in `App/Commands/ShortcutCatalog.swift` (`AppShortcut`),
and applied with `.keyboardShortcut(_ shortcut: AppShortcut)`; don't write raw
`.keyboardShortcut("x", …)` calls (Return/Esc via `.defaultAction` / `.cancelAction` are fine).
`ShortcutCatalogTests` fails if two shortcuts share a key or one takes a reserved system key.

`GameCommands` (the **Game** menu, attached to the Control window scene with `.commands`) calls
the same `GameState` methods as the on-screen buttons. Which items apply in a phase comes from
`GameCommandAvailability`, which `ControlToolbar` also reads. Each shortcut belongs either to a
menu item or to a button, never both. The Buzzers popover's open state is
`BuzzerState.isPopoverPresented` so the menu can open it.

`FileCommands` (the **File** menu) drives `BoardOpenCoordinator`, an `@Observable` created in
`MacopardyApp`. The coordinator owns the import picker, the Play / Edit choice, the "end the
current game?" and "replace editor changes?" confirmations, and the load-error sheet. They are
presented at the root of the Control window by `BoardOpenDialogs`, so they work on the start
screen and mid-game. `RecentBoards` keeps Open Recent in `NSDocumentController` (so the sandbox
remembers access to each file), behind a small storage protocol for tests.

## State

### `GameState` (`Models/GameState.swift`)
The single source of truth for a game in progress. `@Observable`, main-actor, injected with
`.environment(gameState)` into the Control and Display windows.

- `game: Game` — the rounds (`[MacpardyBoard]`), `currentRound`, and `teams`.
- `phase: GamePhase` — which screen is up (see below).
- Per-clue state: `currentQuestion`, `currentCategoryTitle`, `dailyDoubleTeamID`,
  `dailyDoubleWager`, `finalMacpardyWagers`, and a `GameTimer` (15 s).
- Buzz-in response (#59): `answeringTeamID` and a second `GameTimer`, `responseTimer`
  (`GameState.responseSeconds`, 5 s). `teamBuzzedIn(_:)` pauses the question timer and starts
  the response timer; `judgeResponse(teamID:isCorrect:)` ends it and, on wrong, resumes the
  question timer. Phase changes call `cancelResponse()`. `responseCountdown` is what the
  screens draw. None of this is auto-saved.
- All game actions are methods on `GameState` (`selectQuestion`, `revealAnswer`,
  `adjustScore`, `advanceRound`, `setFinalWager`, …). Views call these; they don't mutate
  `game` directly. Each action ends with `triggerSave()`.

### Data model (`Models/`)

```
Game
 ├─ rounds: [MacpardyBoard]        id, title (round title), round: MacpardyRound
 │    └─ categories: [Category]    id, title
 │         └─ questions: [Question] id, value, clue, response,
 │                                  hasBeenPlayed, isDailyDouble, image: QuestionImage?
 ├─ currentRound: Int
 └─ teams: [Team]                   id, name, score, color   (max 4)
```

`MacpardyRound` is `macpardy | doubleMacpardy | finalMacpardy`. A board file's game title is
stored next to the boards, not on them (see [board-format.md](board-format.md)).

### Game phases (`Models/GamePhase.swift`)

```
 setup ──startGame──▶ board ──selectQuestion──▶ question ──revealAnswer──▶ answer
                       ▲  │                        ▲                         │
                       │  └──(Daily Double)──▶ dailyDouble ─submitWager─┘    │
                       └────────────────────── showBoard ◀───────────────────┘

 board ──advanceRound (next is Final)──▶ finalMacpardyCategory  (phones wager)
        ──revealFinalMacpardyQuestion──▶ finalMacpardyQuestion
        ──revealAnswer──▶ finalMacpardyAnswer ──Complete Game──▶ setup
```

Both the Control detail pane (`ControlView+Extension`, `ControlViewContent`) and the Display
(`PresentationView+Extension.phaseContent`) switch on `phase`. Adding a phase means updating
both switches, the localized phase names, and `MacpardyApp.buzzerMode`.

### `BoardEditorSession` (`Models/BoardEditorSession.swift`)
A shared `@Observable` mailbox between the launch screen, the editor window, and the app:
a loaded `BoardDraft` waiting to be edited, boards the user chose to **Play Now**, and
"save before closing?" requests. It's a singleton because the app delegate needs it on quit.

The editor's own state is `BoardDraft` (`Views/Control/CreateMacpardyGameView/Models/`),
a plain value type. `BoardDraft(boards:…)` loads a board into it (validating the 6 × 5 shape)
and `makeBoards()` turns it back into `[MacpardyBoard]`.

## Board files

| Type | Role |
|---|---|
| `BoardPackage` | Read/write `.macpardy` zip packages (`board.json` + `images/`), plain format-2 JSON, and legacy format-1 JSON. Guards against zip bombs and path traversal. |
| `MacpardyBoardsDocument`, `MacpardyJSONBoardDocument` | SwiftUI `FileDocument`s used by save panels |
| `FileManagerService` | Security-scoped reads of user-picked files, default file names |
| `BoardLoader` | "Edit Board": picks a reader by extension (`.json`, `.macpardy`/`.zip`, `.csv`), returns a `BoardDraft` or a `LoadError` that pinpoints the problem |
| `CSVBoardImporter`, `CSVParser`, `CSVBoardTemplate` | CSV → boards, collecting every issue with its row/column |
| `ImageImporter` | Validates, downscales, and re-encodes question pictures |

Formats and limits: [board-format.md](board-format.md), [csv-import.md](csv-import.md).

## Persistence (auto-save)

```
GameState action ─▶ triggerSave() ─▶ GameSnapshot(from: self)
                                        │  debounce 300 ms (cancel previous Task)
                                        ▼
                         GameSaveStore.shared.save(snapshot)   (actor; atomic write)
                         Application Support/Macopardy/saved_game.json
```

- Nothing is saved during `setup`.
- `GameSnapshot` carries `schemaVersion`; a mismatched or corrupt save is discarded on load.
- Pictures are embedded as base64, so a resumed game doesn't need the original board file.
- "Play" checks for a save first and offers to resume (`GameState.restore`).
- **Complete Game** clears the save.

## Phone buzzers

Code: `Services/Buzzer/`. Protocol: [buzzer-protocol.md](buzzer-protocol.md).

```
 MacpardyApp ──syncTeams / syncScores / setMode / openWagering──▶ BuzzerState (@Observable, main actor)
      ▲                                                                │ owns
      │  onWagerSubmitted, firstBuzzTeamID,                            ▼
      │  claimed/disconnected teams              BuzzerServer (actor, NWListener on :8472)
      └─────────────── AsyncStreams ◀──────────   ├─ ClientSession per connection
                                                  ├─ WebSocketFrameParser (hand-rolled RFC 6455)
                                                  ├─ TeamClaimRegistry   who holds which team
                                                  ├─ BuzzerEngine        armed/locked-out/answering
                                                  │    └─ BuzzTieResolver  75 ms window, low score wins
                                                  ├─ FinalWagerBook      Final wagers & limits
                                                  └─ AttemptRateLimiter  join code / claim attempts
```

- **Server lifecycle:** started when a game is selected, stopped when the app returns to the
  launch screen, restarted (new join code) on Complete Game or resume. `BuzzerState` resolves
  the Mac's local IPv4 address and builds the join URL / QR code.
- **App → server:** `MacpardyApp` watches `GameState` and pushes teams, scores, the buzzer
  mode (`armed` on a normal question, `unavailable` on Daily Double, `disabled` otherwise), and
  Final wagering open/closed (open exactly while `phase == .finalMacpardyCategory`).
  It also forwards `BuzzerState.firstBuzzTeamID` to `GameState.teamBuzzedIn`, and sends the
  response timer's start / stop to the phones when `answeringTeamID` changes (the phones
  count down themselves).
- **Server → app:** async streams for claimed teams, the first buzz, wager submissions,
  connection count, and listener failures, surfaced as `BuzzerState` properties.
- **Host actions:** score buttons call `GameState.judgeResponse` and then
  `teamAnsweredWrong` / `teamAnsweredCorrect` on normal clues; the toolbar's Buzzers popover can remove a team's phone.
- **Pure logic is separated from I/O:** `BuzzerEngine`, `TeamClaimRegistry`,
  `FinalWagerBook`, `BuzzTieResolver`, `AttemptRateLimiter`, and `WebSocketFrameParser` are
  `nonisolated` value types with unit tests; `BuzzerServer` wires them to the network.
- Constants (port, heartbeat, tie window, rate limits) are in `BuzzerConstants`.
- The phone UI is a single self-contained page, `Resources/Buzzer/buzzer.html`, served from
  the app bundle.

## Cross-cutting

- **Concurrency:** default isolation is `MainActor`; pure logic is `nonisolated`; I/O lives
  in actors. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#conventions).
- **Localization:** String Catalog `Localizable.xcstrings`, dotted keys per screen.
- **Logging:** `AppLogger` categories `control`, `display`, `database`, `buzzer`.
- **Sandbox:** user-selected file read/write and network server + client. The client
  entitlement is only for accepting buzzer connections (see
  [buzzer-protocol.md](buzzer-protocol.md#sandbox-entitlements)).
- **Build:** Tuist (`Project.swift`) generates the Xcode project; `scripts/export.sh` makes
  a shareable build.
