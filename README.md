# Macopardy

A macOS app for hosting a Jeopardy-style trivia night ("Macpardy!"). The host runs the game
from a control window, the room watches a full-screen display on a TV or projector, and teams
can buzz in from their phones over the local network. No accounts, no server, no internet.

## Features

- Build a game in the editor (6 × 5 boards for two rounds, plus Final Macpardy), with Daily
  Doubles and optional pictures on clues
- Or fill in a CSV template in any spreadsheet app and import it
- Open, edit, and re-save existing games (`.macpardy` packages, `.json`, `.csv`)
- Separate host and audience windows, with timer, scores, Daily Double and Final wagers
- Phone buzzers: scan a QR code, pick a team, buzz; fair tie-breaking, a 5 s response timer and wrong-answer lockout
- Auto-save, so a game can be resumed after a quit or crash
